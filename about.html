    <h1>About Us</h1>
<p>Urdu poetry is a rich and expressive form of artistic expression deeply rooted in the cultural heritage of the Indian subcontinent. It encompasses a wide range of themes, from love and romance to spirituality, social issues, and philosophical reflections. This form of poetry has been cherished for centuries and has produced some of the most renowned poets in history.

One of the distinctive features of Urdu poetry is its use of intricate metaphors, allegories, and symbolism to convey emotions and ideas. It often employs a highly stylized and structured form, with various meters and rhyme schemes. Ghazal and Nazm are two prominent forms within Urdu poetry, each offering a unique style and narrative approach.

<h2>Ghazal :</h2>

<p>A Ghazal is a short lyrical poem characterized by its self-contained couplets, each expressing a complete thought or emotion. These couplets, known as "Sher," are often thematically interconnected but can also stand independently. The beauty of a Ghazal lies in its ability to convey profound sentiments within a limited space, making it a favored medium for exploring themes like love, longing,
and spiritual devotion.</p>

<h2>Nazm :</h2>

<p>Unlike Ghazal, Nazm is a continuous poem with a more straightforward narrative structure. It allows for a longer, more sustained exploration of a particular theme or idea. Nazms often delve into complex social, political, or philosophical subjects, providing a platform for poets to engage deeply with their surroundings and express their perspectives.</p>

<h2>Notable Poets :</h2>

<p>Urdu poetry has seen the emergence of countless revered poets over the centuries. Mir Taqi Mir, Ghalib, Allama Iqbal, Faiz Ahmed Faiz, and Mirza Ghalib are among the most celebrated figures, each contributing significantly to the richness and diversity of Urdu poetic tradition.
